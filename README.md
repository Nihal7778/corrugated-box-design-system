Overview

This project is based on my internship work, where I contributed to the development of Banyan Champ, a solution for optimizing corrugated box design. The system leverages industry knowledge and algorithmic calculations to evaluate millions of combinations of paper grades, flutes, machine parameters, and safety factors — delivering optimal packaging specifications in seconds.

Problem Statement
No scientific way to evolve box specifications

Trial-and-error methods were expensive and time-consuming

Frequent design failures in the field led to penalties and loss of customer confidence

Solution
Developed using 40+ years of industry experience

Patented algorithm to calculate Box Compression Strength (BCT), Bursting Strength, and ECT

Automated workflows for:
Box design specifications

Corrugator machine parameters

Conversion and printing costs

Customer and employee management

Features
📊 Specification Design: Input box dimensions, paper grades, and safety factors

⚙️ Machine Management: Corrugator width, cut length, flute profiles, wastage, and trim

💰 Cost Optimization: Conversion cost, printing cost, and operating margins

👥 User Roles: Employee, Admin, and Super Admin with different access levels

🧮 System Calculations: Automated compression strength and safety factor adjustments

Tech Stack
Python / SQL for data handling and calculations

Excel / Power BI for system calculations and reporting

GitHub for version control and collaboration


My Role
During my internship, I:

Designed workflows for Admin and Employee modules

Structured machine and cost data for system calculations

Automated safety factor and compression strength calculations

Documented the process in PPTs and Excel for integration into the system
